                Firewall Mason is a firewall ruleset editing tool taking into consideration independent targets of several teams, operating on top of single firewall policy. 
                Traditionally this task would be done via ticketing system, with independent teams rising firewall requests to firewall team, which would implement the rules
                in ad-hoc fashion. This approach however always left the rules implemented on the firewall without ownership and in time firewalls became full of old/depricated 
                rules that nobody is sure if they can be removed and a typical FW mess is born. 
                <br><br>
                Firewall Mason proposes alternative approach where rules ownership is done directly by allowing all teams to craft the rules they need in a simple visual tool, 
                and then merge multiple ruleset of these teams to a central repository. <br><br>
                <font class="content-subheader">NOTE:</font> Non-admin groups are only allowed 'permit' rules so that rule specific order problems are avoided.

                Furthermore, Firewall Mason supports location aware system maps, that allow for definition of systems, that span several different locations, 
                and firewall rules can be adjusted during export to only apply rules that have a potential to be hit on that firewall. For example if you locations 
                A, B and C, and you specify ruleset for system that exists only in location A and B, this part of your ruleset will not be applied to firewalls in location C.

                Lastly, Firewall Mason is NOT a firewall configuration tool, it's job is management of rules and 
                the output is either a JSON or CVS file with the firewall rules for a specific location. While we might consider adding 
                firewall configuration API in the future (definitelly possible for REST API based firewalls that can take json input), this is not
                currently in the roadmap.
